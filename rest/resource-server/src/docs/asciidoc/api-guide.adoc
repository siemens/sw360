[[overview]]
== Overview

[[overview-introduction]]
=== Introduction
This guide provides you with a detailed description how to use the RESTful sw360 services. For actual changes and additions to the REST API, please refer to the change log of your deployed sw360 version https://github.com/eclipse/sw360/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

[[overview-http-verbs]]
=== HTTP verbs

The sw360 REST API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource (complete update)

| `PATCH`
| Used to update an existing resource (partial updates)

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
=== HTTP status codes

The sw360 REST API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `401 Unauthorized`
| Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided

| `403 Forbidden`
| The request was valid, but the server is refusing action. The user might not have the necessary permissions for a resource, or may need an account of some sort

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist

| `405 Method Not Allowed`
| A request method is not supported for the requested resource

| `409 Conflict`
| A conflict can occur, when a resource shall be created and a resource with the same unique attribute (e.g. name) already exists

| `415 Unsupported Media Type`
| The request entity has a media type which the server or resource does not support

| `500 Internal Server Error`
| An internal server error occurred. Information about the cause can be found in the response body
|===

[[overview-headers]]
=== Headers

Every response has the following header(s):

include::{snippets}/should_document_headers/response-headers.adoc[]

[[overview-errors]]
=== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

include::{snippets}/should_document_error_internal_error/response-fields.adoc[]

For example, a request that attempts to get a non-existent project will produce a
`500 Internal Server Error` response:

include::{snippets}/should_document_error_internal_error/http-response.adoc[]

[[overview-hypermedia]]
=== Hypermedia

The sw360 REST API's RESTful web service uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their
responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application Language (HAL)]
format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should
not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate

[[token]]
== Token

This chapter provides information about the sw360 authorization token.

Please note that the following text represents a general documentation.

For the deployments inside the Siemens group company, please consider the following guide:

https://wiki.siemens.com/display/en/SW360+RESTful+API

[[token-request]]
=== Token Request - REST API Tokens

You can create a new REST API token over the sw360portal itself. +
Please login to the sw360 application and navigate to 'Preferences'. +
A new REST API token can be generated by pressing the 'Generate Token' button.
This token is not stored in application so you should keep it by your own.

The token can used as Authorization Header (`Authorization: Token <API-Token>`)in the URL.


[[token-additional]]
=== Additional

Please note: Read / Write access to the REST API is controlled by sw360 Granted Authority.
You can configure the sw360 Granted Authority by changing the properties file (sw360.properties).
